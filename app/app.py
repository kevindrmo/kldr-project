# Some intro, some exploration and final things to show
# think about how you want to present it in the end --> power point? only showing app? html presentation? maybe an html presentation that accesses my streamlit page?
# dashboard data overview, analysis page ....


# in scripts: data-cleaning before --> only put clean data in the actual app
